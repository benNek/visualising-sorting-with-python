# Visualising Sorting with Python - Recursion

In this lesson, students will look at some classical solutions to various mathematical problems that utilise recursion.

## Learning objectives

- To understand what is meant by the term recursion
- To be able to implement some simple recursive algorithms in Python

## Learning outcomes

### All students are able to

- Describe what is meant by recursion.

### Most students are able to

- Implement recursive solutions to finding factorials and gcd

### Some students are able to

- Implement recursive solutions to detecting palindromes and creating a fibonnaci sequence.

## Lesson Summary

- Students are provided with a gentle introduction to recursion by using recursive algorithms to find factorials of a number and the gcd of two numbers.
- Students can attmept to independently create recursive functions in Python to detect palindromes and create the Fibonnaci sequence.
