# Visualising Sorting with Python - Insertion Sort

In this lesson studetns will implement an Insertion Sort in Python, and visualise it's action using Matplotlib

## Learning objectives

- To understand the mechanics and performance of the Insertion Sort algorithm
- Something else

## Learning outcomes

### All students are able to

- Describe the basic mechanics of the Insertion Sort algorithm

### Most students are able to

- Implement an Insertion Sort in Python
- Describe in detail the mechanics of the Insertion Sort algorithm

### Some students are able to

- Critically analyse the performance of the algorithm and identify it's weakesses 

## Lesson Summary

- Students use Matplotlib to visualise a single element beign sorted using the algorithm.
- Students implement the full sorting algorithm

## Starter

- Insertion sort can easily be visualised using a pack of cards.

## Main development

## Plenary

## Extension
