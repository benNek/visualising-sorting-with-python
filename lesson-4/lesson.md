# Visualising Sorting with Python - Insertion Sort

In this lesson students will implement a Selection Sort in Python, and visualise it's action using Matplotlib

## Learning objectives

- To understand the mechanics and performance of the Selection Sort algorithm
- To be able to program a Selection Sort algorithm in Python

## Learning outcomes

### All students are able to

- Describe the basic mechanics of the Selection Sort algorithm

### Most students are able to

- Implement a Selection Sort in Python
- Describe in detail the mechanics of the Selection Sort algorithm

### Some students are able to

- Critically analyse the performance of the algorithm and identify it's weaknesses 

## Lesson Summary

- Students use Matplotlib to visualise a single element being sorted using the algorithm.
- Students implement the full sorting algorithm

## Starter

- Selection sort can easily be visualised using a pack of cards.

- The first card is looked at and assumed to be the lowest.
- All the cards are iterated through, with the actual lowest value card being stored.
- The lowest value card is swapped with the first card.
- The second card is looked at and assumed to be the lowest.
- All succeeding cards are iterated through, with the actual lowest being stored.
- The lowest of the succeeding cards is swapped with the second card.
- This continues until the cards are sorted.

## Main development

- The students can work their way through the worksheet, slowly building up the selection sort algorithm until it is complete.

## Plenary

- Have students compare the speed of their bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort algorithms.
- They can remove their `display()` function calls and provide the algorithms with very large lists - 5000 items should do.


## Extension

- Have students research optimisation to the selection sort algorithm
