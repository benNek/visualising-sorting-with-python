# Visualising Sorting with Python - Insertion Sort

In this lesson students will implement an Insertion Sort in Python, and visualise it's action using Matplotlib

## Learning objectives

- To understand the mechanics and performance of the Insertion Sort algorithm
- Something else

## Learning outcomes

### All students are able to

- Describe the basic mechanics of the Insertion Sort algorithm

### Most students are able to

- Implement an Insertion Sort in Python
- Describe in detail the mechanics of the Insertion Sort algorithm

### Some students are able to

- Critically analyse the performance of the algorithm and identify it's weaknesses 

## Lesson Summary

- Students use Matplotlib to visualise a single element being sorted using the algorithm.
- Students implement the full sorting algorithm

## Starter

- Insertion sort can easily be visualised using a pack of cards.
- Deal out a hand of 5 cards (If you have enough you could deal these out to the students, or to 10 groups at least)
- The card on the far left is ignored.
- The next card along is left in place if larger, or swapped if smaller.
- The next card along is then moved left until it reaches the correct place in the hand.
- This can be repeated two more times, to order the hand.

## Main development

- The students can work their way through the worksheet, slowly building up the insertion sort algorithm until it is complete.

## Plenary

- Have students compare the speed of their bubble sort and insertion sort algorithms.
- They can remove their `display()` function calls and provide the algorithms with very large lists - 5000 items should do.


## Extension

- Have students research optimisation to the insertion sort algorithm
