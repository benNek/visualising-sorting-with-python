# Visualising Sorting with Python - Bubblesort

In this lesson studetns will implement a bubblesort in Python, and visualise it's action using Matplotlib

## Learning objectives

- To understand the mechanics and performance of the bubblesort algorithm
- Something else

## Learning outcomes

### All students are able to

- Swap variables around using tupple unpacking
- Describe the basic mechanics of the bubblesort algorithm

### Most students are able to

- Implement a bubblesort in Python
- Describe in detail the mechanics of the bubblesort algorithm

### Some students are able to

- Critically analyse the performance of the algorithm and identify it's weakesses 

## Lesson Summary

- Students step through how to swap variables and elements in a list.
- Students look at swapping elements in a list using loops, based on an items size, to implement a bubblesort.

## Starter

- Give a student a book and ask her to find a particular numbered page.
- Ask the student to describe the process by which they found the numbered page.
- Explain that it is much easier to find an item in a collection of items, if they are all in order.
- You could demonstrate this using a pack of shuffeled and unshuffled cards.
- Hopefully the students will realise why being able to sort data is important.

## Main development

1. You may wish to describe the bubblesort algorithm to the class, or you could use one of many video clips that are available:

1. If you dislike your students, feel free to make them do a *bubblesort dance* like many mean-spirited CS teachers have done in the past.

1. Have students work through the worksheet until they have implemented a bubblesort. 

## Plenary

- Ask students to comment on the efficiency of the Bubblesort algorithm, for instance are there any operations that are conducted that are wasteful?

## Extension

- Students can look online to find examples of *optimised* bubblesorts and try to explain why these are improvements
