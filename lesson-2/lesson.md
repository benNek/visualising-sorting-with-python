# Visualising Sorting With Python - Bubble sort

In this lesson students will implement a bubble sort in Python, and visualise its action using matplotlib.

## Learning objectives

- To understand the mechanics and performance of the bubble sort algorithm

## Learning outcomes

### All students are able to

- Swap variables around using tuple unpacking
- Describe the basic mechanics of the bubble sort algorithm

### Most students are able to

- Implement a bubble sort in Python
- Describe the mechanics of the bubble sort algorithm in detail

### Some students are able to

- Critically analyse the performance of the algorithm and identify its weaknesses 

## Lesson summary

- Students step through how to swap variables and elements in a list
- Students look at swapping elements in a list using loops, based on an item's size, to implement a bubble sort

## Starter

- Give a student a book and ask her to find a particular numbered page
- Ask the student to describe the process by which they found the numbered page
- Explain that it's much easier to find an item in a collection of items if they're all in order
- You could demonstrate this using a pack of shuffled and unshuffled cards
- This will aid the students in realising why being able to sort data is important

## Main development

1. You may wish to describe the bubble sort algorithm to the class; alternatively, you could use one of many video clips that are available, or the gif below:

1. If you dislike your students, feel free to make them do a *bubble sort dance* like many mean-spirited CS teachers have done in the past.

1. Have students work through the worksheet until they have implemented a bubble sort. 

## Plenary

- Ask students to comment on the efficiency of the bubble sort algorithm. For instance, are there any operations conducted that are wasteful? The final run of the `for` loop will always iterate over a sorted list, for example.

## Extension

- Students can look online to find examples of *optimised* bubble sorts and try to explain why these are improvements.
