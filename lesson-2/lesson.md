# Visualising Sorting with Python - Bubble sort

In this lesson students will implement a bubble sort in Python, and visualise it's action using Matplotlib

## Learning objectives

- To understand the mechanics and performance of the bubble sort algorithm
- Something else

## Learning outcomes

### All students are able to

- Swap variables around using tupple unpacking
- Describe the basic mechanics of the bubble sort algorithm

### Most students are able to

- Implement a bubble sort in Python
- Describe in detail the mechanics of the bubble sort algorithm

### Some students are able to

- Critically analyse the performance of the algorithm and identify it's weaknesses 

## Lesson Summary

- Students step through how to swap variables and elements in a list.
- Students look at swapping elements in a list using loops, based on an items size, to implement a bubble sort.

## Starter

- Give a student a book and ask her to find a particular numbered page.
- Ask the student to describe the process by which they found the numbered page.
- Explain that it is much easier to find an item in a collection of items, if they are all in order.
- You could demonstrate this using a pack of shuffled and unshuffled cards.
- Hopefully the students will realise why being able to sort data is important.

## Main development

1. You may wish to describe the bubble sort algorithm to the class, or you could use one of many video clips that are available, or the gif below.

1. If you dislike your students, feel free to make them do a *bubble sort dance* like many mean-spirited CS teachers have done in the past.

1. Have students work through the worksheet until they have implemented a bubble sort. 

## Plenary

- Ask students to comment on the efficiency of the Bubble sort algorithm, for instance are there any operations that are conducted that are wasteful?
- The final run of the `for` loop will always iterate over a sorted list (for instance).

## Extension

- Students can look online to find examples of *optimised* bubble sorts and try to explain why these are improvements
