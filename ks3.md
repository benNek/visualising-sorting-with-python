- Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem.
- Understands a recursive solution to aproblem repeatedly applies the same solution to smaller instances of the problem.
- Understands the notion of performance for algorithms and appreciates that some algorithms have different performance characteristics for the same task.
- Evaluates the effectiveness of algorithms and models for similar problems.
